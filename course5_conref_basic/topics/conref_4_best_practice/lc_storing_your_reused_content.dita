						<p class="- topic/p ">It’s good practice to hold your reusable elements in warehouse topics. These are topics that are written specifically for reuse rather than for direct publication. By following this practice you will avoid creating <q class="- topic/q ">spaghetti references</q> - referenced elements at random points within a publication. Having unpredictable  referenced element locations means that you can’t easily manage the dependencies of one topic to another. </p><p class="- topic/p ">By keeping your reusable elements in defined locations, your referenced element won’t be removed from the map unintentionally. As long as the warehouse topics are included in the publication map, their referenced elements will be available to resolve conrefs.</p><p class="- topic/p ">Some component content management systems may have specific requirements for where reused content must be stored. For example, some systems require that all content included in a map, including content included solely for reuse, be stored in a folder beneath the folder that holds the map. Check the requirements of your CCMS if you’re in doubt.</p>
