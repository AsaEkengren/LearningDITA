    <p>In DITA, a constraint lets you eliminate elements that you do not need or want to use. For
                example, if you are not documenting software code, you could eliminate
                &lt;codeblock> and &lt;codephrase>. Constraining reduces the number of elements
                presented to the authors, which makes their lives a little easier.</p>
