        <p>The most commonly used markup language is HTML. XML is similar to HTML; it also uses
            angle brackets to indicate elements (like &lt;p>). Many of the tags in DITA XML are
            also found in HTML.</p>
        <p>In XML, you must be careful to open and close all tags properly. HTML is forgiving
            when you make mistakes. XML requires you to provide a file that is tagged correctly;
            if you make any error in the encoding, parsing will stop. This is known as draconian
            error handling, and it is a controversial part of the XML specification.</p>
        <p>DITA is a markup language and is a flavor of XML. DITA allows you to mark up content
            semantically; the tag markup tells the author about the meaning of the markup.</p>
