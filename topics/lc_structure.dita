            <p>DITA enforces structure and standard for an authoring environment. Typically, an
                information architecture will set up the overall environment.</p>
            <p>Content has implicit structure, even in a word processor. DITA models and enforces
                that structure explicitly. For example, a task topic must have at least one step.
                The result is that all task topics are structured consistently. </p>
