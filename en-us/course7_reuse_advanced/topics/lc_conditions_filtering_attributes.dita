            <p>DITA conditional filtering allows to choose what to show and hide in your DITA topics
                when they are processed for output. </p>
            <p>You mark DITA elements for filtering by adding attributes to elements; the value you
                use with an attribute is used to determine whether the element should be hidden
                (filtered out) or shown.  </p>
            <p>The four basic attributes that you use to filter elements are: <sl>
                    <sli>audience</sli>
                    <sli>platform</sli>
                    <sli>product</sli>
                    <sli>otherprops</sli>
                </sl></p>
            <p>For example, you might use the platform attribute to indicate whether content is
                intended for iPhone or Android users. </p>
            <pre>&lt;p platform="android">Visit Google Play for more information.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p platform="iphone">Visit the App Store for more information.&lt;/p></pre>
            <p>When generating output for Android users, you can tell the DITA filtering mechanism
                to hide elements where platform="iphone" and show elements where platform="android".
                To generate output for iPhone users, you show elements where platform="iphone" and
                hide elements where platform="android". (How to hide and show content is described
                later in this lesson.)</p>
            <p>The names of these attributes are simply a starting point; itâ€™s up to you to
                determine how you want to use each one. Similarly, the values you use with each of
                the filtering attributes is up to you to decide. </p>
            <p>The single most important thing, however, is that all content creators in your group,
                team, company, or organization agree on the purpose of each of the attributes and
                the values to use with the attributes. </p>
            <note>The four attributes listed here are just a starting point. It is possible to use
                DITA specialization to create additional filtering attributes that have meaning for
                your content. </note>
